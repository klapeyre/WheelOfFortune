To get started with development on this project:

1. Install Full Haskell Platform (not just core)
2. Clone this repository
3. From the main directory (wheelOfFortune), type 'cabal run'. This should compile and run the program, and print out the hello world.
4. Dependencies for Gloss (drawing pictures, GUI etc) already installed. Let me know if any issues.


Game functionality complete.

Future considerations:
- adding AI support
- multiple puzzles in a game with accumulated winnings
